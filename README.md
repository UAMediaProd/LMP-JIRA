# Media Hub REST Server

Node.js server hosting for the rare API or Server-Side functions we need to use.


## Dev Notes

Right now, the direction for this is

- Server-Side functions to connect to the LMP JIRA instance and create new tickets for the LMP Web Form
- Using the above principle to create a form which can create issues for Alliance Program Changelogs

This is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/~lmp-rest), and primary development makes sense to occur there and then exported back here for version control and management by LMP team.
